# Get Started with Thingy:91 and Telenor MIC

So you've got your Thingy:91 dev-kit, what' next? In this short guide we'll tell you how to set up a "Thing" in MIC, Managed IoT Cloud, and how to view data sent by your Thingy:91.

## 1. Sign Up For a MIC Platform Account

If you already have a MIC account you can start directly at step 2. 

You can **Sign-up** for a MIC account here: https://demonorway.mic.telenorconnexion.com

Click on the "Sign Up" button in the upper right corner and follow the instructions in order to sign up. It is important that you fill out at least the **six first fields** in addition to **company**. This is a prerequisite for being verified as a user. 

**Note:** You should be aware that the signup is two-phased, and after you have confirmed your email address it may take some time before your user account is activated. This is a manual verification process and may take up to 24 hours outside normal business hours. Once your account is ready for use you will receive an email stating that your account has been activated. 
You can however continue.
